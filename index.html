      <p>Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and 
      about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more 
      than a thousand pounds (the polar bear). They're found 
      throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.</p>

      <p>Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs 
      alone are taller than many humansâ€”about 6 feet. These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles 
      an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.</p>

      <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats 
      are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length 
      and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.</p>

      <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also 
      known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys 
      except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based 
      on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope.</p>

      <p>Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils at the end; 
      this allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body is underwater. 
      The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail; adults have dark stripes on the tail. 
      It's easy to distinguish an alligator from a crocodile by the teeth.</p>
